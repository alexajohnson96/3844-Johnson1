								<p>I found this unit as a whole to be very interesting and compelling. I love learning more about HTML, because honestly before this class I knew the code for paragraph and that was about it. I also enjoyed the reading, and am extremely fascinated by the concept of free culture and rip, mix, burn because I see it just about every aspect of my daily life. I also find the VT-shaped student concept extremely compelling. This is a concept I have heard of before, so I was extrememly excited to be talking about it more in-depth in this class. I have always strived to put well-roundedness and greater understanding above making perfect grades and knowing everything about one thing. I think it is so important to have those experiences such as internships and study abroad (those intentional education experiences that make up the “V” in VT-shaped student). So personally, I think it is vital and truly riveting that this concept is being implemented and that we have a new office dedicated to helping students formulate their college experience in a “VT-shape” in order to get the best education and be the most prepared to go into the world as an effective member of society. I also found it extremely interesting to learn more about the perspectives of those at the origin of this concept, such as Provost Rikakis and Dean Spiller.</p>
								<p>I found the most interesting thing about HTML to be just learning more complex things that helped make a webpage go from something that your mother would be disappointed in (as Professor Evia would say) to something that looks like (and functions as) a legitamate website. I found HTML challenging only because it is different to what I am used to doing. I’ve always written things in word documents, and almost always used website designing tools (like Wix, Squarespace, etc.) to make webpages. Getting down all the codes and really understanding how the code is structured was challenging but extremely useful and interesting.</p>
								<p>My notion of digital writing has changed drastically. Like I said, I have always written on word documents and used website designing tools. When I thought of “digital writing,” I honestly thought of writing on a word document and copy-pasting in to a web page. Honestly, when I saw that I had to write a reading response in HTML I was shocked, and immediately wondered why. Now I know that there is so much more to digital writing than words on a document. Now when I think of digital writing, I think of HTML code and CSS. I feel as if I have a much greater understanding of digital media, and so much more control over the digital media I will create moving forward.  The little knowledge I had of HTML prior to this unit was so surface. Most of the things I thought I knew, aside from the paragraph code, were even wrong, like the fact that the difference between h1 and h2 isn’t text size. </p>
								<p>I have really enjoyed expanding my knowledge of HTML and the VT-shaped student in this unit. These are things I have already encountered in my college career so far, but I felt as if they were glossed over, despite their importance. I see now how my classwork falls in to the VT shape, and how my experiences and involvement so far will help to shape me as a greater member of society after college.</p>
