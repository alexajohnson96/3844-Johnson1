								<p>In this class, we have analyzed and worked to apply the concept of the VT-shaped student in the context of our majors and career goals. Our group created a fictional podcast to show the importance of interdisciplinary learning (such as HTML for an English student) and created a video to show the different opportunities that students can take advantage of to enhance the "V" part of the VT-shaped student. </p>
								<h2>T shape Podcast</h2>
<iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/314021849&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>
<p>Our group's podcast followed an English student as she learns the importance of technology to not only her major but to all majors. After initially resisting learning HTML coding as an English student, she begins to get more comfortable with it, and use it for her own writing. After being picked on by an engineering student who thinks that technology is only important for her own major, the English student proves herself and her coding ability by hacking NASA's website to publish poetry. The story is meant to emphasize the importance of the horizontal part of the "T," learning interdisciplinary skills (especially technology) and how to apply it to any major, even one in liberal arts.</p>

								<h2>V shape Video</h2>
								<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zZToI2owasw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Our video showed three students as they attempted to navigate which experience to choose for summer. We had each student have the majors of the members in our group. The video begins with each student visiting their academic advisor with issues they are encountering with different summer opportunities. These issues are based on real issues that we have observed that students encounter when trying to get those "V" experiences. Each student was guided towards opportunities (study abroad, internship, volunteer opportunity) that would give them relevant and useful experience to help round out their education and strengthen their skills to better prepare them for a career. The video was meant to show the different opportunities that fit in to the "V" and to emphasize the importance and benefits of choosing the experience that will benefit the student most.</p>

<p>Through these projects, we have learned about the VT-shape student concept and how to apply it to our own majors and interests. Looking at the V and the T parts separately really helped me to understand each in relation to my own education, and creating the video and podcast caused me to think critically about the entire concept. I have also learned, personally, how to utilize this concept in order to make myself a more well-rounded student and more prepared individual as I prepare to join the workforce.</p>
