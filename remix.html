								<p>I have found the theme “Rip, mix, burn” has weaved it’s way through every reading/group of readings we have done in this class so far. The following quotes show how this theme is evident in the readings on technology, creativity, and the VT-Shaped student.</p>
								<h2>Technology</h2>
								<p>In World Brain, H. G. Wells dreamed of <strong>“a world synthesis of bibliography and documentation with the indexed archives of the world,”</strong> (p. 85).</p>
								<p>Bush desired progress as well. He wrote, <strong>“The summation of human experience is being expanded at a prodigious rate, and the means we use for threading through the consequent maze to the momentarily important item is the same as was used in the days of square-rigged ships.”</strong> He then discusses progress occurring for several technologies and talks of what the future may hold.</p>
								<p>He eventually came to call for a <strong>“process by which man profits by his inheritance of acquired knowledge.”</strong> His description of the “memex” shares many of the ideas of a computer and the many resources afforded by the internet. This quote stuck out to me as one particularly relevant to how rip, mix, and burn characterizes digital composting across media today. Especially when it comes to the internet, specifically social media, people take their acquired knowledge and use it on other mediums. Students may take html knowledge learned in class for website building to construct a personal blog. This rip, mix, and burn gets far more creative in terms of content, as discussed below.</p>
								<p>Building on the idea of information in a central, accessible place (ripping, mixing, and burning), Berners-Lee proposes a system of organization so that people within a company or organization could avoid losing information over time and could have an easier way to access existing data (which would eventually become the World Wide Web).</p> <p>He states, <strong>“the aim would be to allow a place to be found for any information or reference which one felt was important, and a way of finding it afterwards.”</strong></p>
								<h2>Creativity</h2>
								<p>In Free Culture, the actual concept of “rip, mix, and burn” was introduced.<strong>“In all of these cases, Disney (or Disney, Inc.) ripped creativity from the culture around him, mixed that creativity with his own extraordinary talent, and then burned that mix into the soul of his culture. Rip, mix, burn.”</strong> This is kind of like all of the minds in the technology readings had taken and further developed existing technologies to create more modern ones to add to and meet the needs of our society.</p>
								<p><strong>“Creators here and everywhere are always and at all times building upon the creativity that went before and that surrounds them now.”</strong> This quote again shows how rip, mix, and burn characterizes digital composting across media. We are in a world of self-generated content, whether it is a facebook status, a blog post, or a new meme. Others can take this content and either respond, or make their own, putting rip, mix, and burn into action. </p>
								<p>The concept of a free culture, one that allows such ripping, mixing, and burning, was also introduced. <strong>"...every society has left a certain bit of its culture free for the taking...free cultures are cultures that leave a great deal open for others to build upon," (p. 29-30)</strong></p>
								<h2>Virginia Tech’s own “Rip, Mix, and Burn”</h2>
								<p><strong>“Recently, leaders in higher education, industry, government, foundations, and professional associations have encouraged the development of T-shaped student and professionals…Virginia Tech looks to expand this model, creating ‘VT-shaped students.’”</strong> (Undergraduate Academic Affairs Article)</p>
								<p><strong>“An education from Virginia Tech goes beyond the ‘T’ shape by incorporating elements of Ut Prosim and the land-grant mission to create a ‘VT-shaped individual.’”</strong> (Beyond Boundaries)</p>
								<p>Basically, by ripping the T shape, mixing it with the V, and implementing it (burning), Virginia Tech is setting up students to contribute to society in the very same rip, mix, and burn fashion.</p>
								<p>In terms of rip, mix, and burn in English classes for VT-Shaped students, students can rip from their experiences beyond the classroom (the experiences that make up the "V" in the VT-shaped student), mix those experiences and learnings into work, communication, and leadership, and burn something innovative, new, and creative in their work.</p>
								<p><strong>“To create these kinds of learners, it may be useful to remember that, alongside invention, we need to find both inspiration and imagination…technology never works without people as part of the equation, because innovation is fundamentally a human pursuit.”</strong> (Elizabeth Spiller)</p>
								<p>I view innovation, inspiration, and imagination as basically concepts at the heart of rip, mix, and burn for VT-shaped students at our university, in English classes and beyond.</p>
