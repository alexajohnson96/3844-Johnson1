								<p>I have quite a few interests here at Virginia Tech. My general interests include writing, photography, and travelling, and I have found a way to intertwine those interests in many things that I am involved in outside of my courses.</p>
								<h2> Chi Omega </h2>
								<p>I joined Chi Omega, one of Virginia Tech's thirteen sororities, the spring semester of my freshman year. I am currently in my second term as Chi Omega's historian. In this position, I work with the rest of the marketing team to market our chapter on social media and on campus. I am in charge of taking pictures at events, printing pictures to go in our chapter house, and organizing chapter pictures, among other things. I do not use digital writing in this position, the only writing I do here is in the form of email annoucements.</p>
								<h2>Collegiate Times</h2>
								<p>I am on the photography staff for the Collegiate Times newspaper. I joined the photo staff fall semester of my freshman year. I love shooting sports and have gotten to take pictures on the football field for the past two seasons. I don't do a whole lot of digital writing in this position past writing photo captions. </p>
								<h2>Global Education Office</h2>
								<p>I am currently working at Virginia Tech's Global Education Office as the communications assistant. I started this position in August, 2016 after studying abroad in London during the summer of 2016. In this position, I develop content for the GEO's social media and blog, as well as write news stories for VT News, all for the purpose of promoting and shedding light on study abroad. I also take pictures of events and to accompany news and blog content. This interest has the most to do with digital writing. I write a lot of content, and sometimes use HTML code on the blog and the website. I think this facet of my college life plays in to the concept of the VT-Shaped student the most out of everything I am involved with. In this job, I am getting real-world experience in my field of study, and I am also getting to draw on my study abroad experience to help influence others to study abroad. Studying abroad is named as one of the "intentional education opportunities" that help make up part of the &quot;V&quot; in the VT-shaped student.</p>
