										<h2><a href="#">Interests</a></h2>
										<p>A bit about my interests here at Virginia Tech, my goals for the future, and how these things fit in to the VT-shaped student model.</p>

								<p>I have quite a few interests here at Virginia Tech. My general interests include writing, photography, and traveling, and I have found a way to intertwine those interests in many things that I am involved in outside of my courses.</p>
								<h2> Chi Omega </h2>
								<p>I joined Chi Omega, one of Virginia Tech's thirteen sororities, the spring semester of my freshman year. I am currently in my second term as Chi Omega's historian. In this position, I work with the rest of the marketing team to market our chapter on social media and on campus. I am in charge of taking pictures at events, printing pictures to go in our chapter house, and organizing chapter pictures, among other things. I do not use digital writing in this position, the only writing I do here is in the form of email announcements. This gives me out-of-classroom experience with leadership and allows me to develop my photography skills and portfolio.</p>
								<h2>Collegiate Times</h2>
								<p>I am on the photography staff for the Collegiate Times newspaper. I joined the photo staff fall semester of my freshman year. I love shooting sports and have gotten to take pictures on the football field for the past two seasons. I don't do a whole lot of digital writing in this position past writing photo captions. However, my involvement in this organization has given me real-world experience working for a newspaper, which could possibly be something I do at some point in my career. Knowing the do's and don'ts of photojournalism and how the dynamics work between editors, writers, and photographers is not something I could have learned in a classroom.</p>
								<h2>Study Abroad</h2>
								<p>Last summer after completing my sophomore year, I spent five weeks studying in London. This program was for English, History, and Classics, (so not in my major) but I knew I wanted to study abroad so I made the credits work for me as CLE credits (the horizontal part of the "T"). Even though this was a shorter program in terms of study abroad, the connections I made with both faculty and other students and the global perspective, independence, and cultural understanding I gained really changed me as a person. The trip was truly a highlight of my college experience and helped lead to many other opportunities, such as my enrollment in a research seminar and my job at the Global Education Office.</p>
								<h2>Global Education Office</h2>
								<p>I am currently working at Virginia Tech's Global Education Office as the communications assistant. I started this position in August, 2016 after studying abroad in London during the summer of 2016. In this position, I develop content for the GEO's social media and blog, as well as write news stories for VT News, all for the purpose of promoting and shedding light on study abroad. I also take pictures of events and to accompany news and blog content. This interest has the most to do with digital writing. I write a lot of content, and sometimes use HTML code on the blog and the website. I think this facet of my college life plays in to the concept of the VT-Shaped student the most out of everything I am involved with. In this job, I am getting real-world experience in my field of study, and I am also getting to draw on my study abroad experience to help influence others to study abroad. Studying abroad is named as one of the "intentional education opportunities" that help make up part of the &quot;V&quot; in the VT-shaped student. </p>
								<h2>Internships</h2>
								<p>I have had internships for the past two summers in my field of study. The first was as a communications intern at the Richmond SPCA, and the second was as a marketing and PR intern for the Habitat for Humanity in my town. This summer, I will work as a Government Relations and Advocacy intern at Habitat International. All of these experiences have given me real world experience and have helped to strengthen the skills I learn in my classes.</p>

								<h2>Goals and Application</h2>
								<p>My goal is to take all of the experiences, both in class and out of class, to fully develop in-major skills as well as my ability to apply my courses and experiences to my career in a successful way. I think that my involvement and interests are great examples of experiences that make up a VT shape student, and I hope to carry that over in to my post-graduate life. Taking advantage of experiences that fill the sections of the V and the T in the VT-shape student will allow me to fulfill these goals.</p>
